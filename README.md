# CSS TRAINING

This Repo includes all the files I had completed while I am learning CSS
The main training material that I am using is from freeCodeCamp youtube channel for CSS Tutorial 

Feel free to provide a feedback or any changes to my Repository as I am also trying to learn Git and GitHub while completing the CSS Tutorial

oh is this the page that I could easily edit this?
will this work as an additional commit to my file?
I'll be testing it first since I'm not making any progress in my entries here in github
now testing again since I have created a branch
I think it worked
but I have no idea what is going on
